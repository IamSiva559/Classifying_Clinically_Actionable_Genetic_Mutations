 Problem statement:
                    Currently interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. We need to develop a Machine Learning model to automatically classifies genetic variations.
