# Classifying_Clinically_Actionable_Genetic_Mutations

# Project Overview

# Objective: 
           Currently interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. We need to develop a Machine Learning model to automatically classifies genetic variations to distinguish the mutations that contribute to tumor growth from the neutral mutations.
                         
# Deliverables:
               1. Valuable insihts on machine learning models and techniques to solve real world medical challenge
